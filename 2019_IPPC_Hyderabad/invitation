Dear xxxxxx,

We are organizing a symposium on the broad theme of remote sensing and machine learning for invasive species detection in the International Plant Protection Congress. It will be held in Hyderabad from 10-14 November this year. We are pleased to invite you to give a talk in the session. If you accept our invitation, please send us: 1) a confirmation of your attendance; 2) tentative title of your talk and a short abstract by June 21, 2019.

The details of the proposal are given below. If you yourself cannot make it, it would be kind of you to recommend somebody else who might be interested. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely, 

Abhijin Adiga
 
Title of the symposium: Remote sensing and machine learning for determination of spatio-temporal distribution of invasive species.

Venue: International Plant Protection Congress, Hyderabad, India, Nov. 10-14, 2019.

A brief background: In 1992, the International Convention on Biological Diversity identified invasive alien species are the second worst threat after habitat destruction and set global priorities and guidelines to collect information and coordinate innternational actions for their management. One of the several changes caused by climate change is the emergence of invasive speices. Warming of temperature as a consequence of climate change which supports to create a new habitat for the invasive species, threatens native biodiversity, transforms species composition of the ecosystem, displaces native biota, and changes ecosystem structure and functioning. Studies conducted in the Himalaya and other regions on utilizing remote sensing and machine learning in identifying spatio-temporal distribution of invasive weeds such as Ageratina adenophora, Chromolaena odorata, Lantana camara, Mikania micrantha, Parthenium hysterophorus and others will be presented.

Scientific section: Remote sensing and modeling for pest forecasting

Name of organizer/co-organizers: R. Muniappan and Pramod Jha
