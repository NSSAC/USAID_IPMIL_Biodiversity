USAID: A High-resolution Interaction Based Approach to Modeling the Spread of Agricultural Invasive Species

Candid assessment of future prospects (e.g., PM likes us, but funding uncertain; we are at the forefront of a fast-moving area; research aspects not a good match for NSSAC interests)

The entire program will end in Nov. 2021. PM would like to actively work with us when the IPM Innovation lab competes for the next round. Revised USAID objectives (technical) are in line with NSSAC line of research.

Gaps: Yes or no: no
are skills available in NSSAC;? yes
is there sufficient T&E available? Before / after COVID? yes
is the project funding commensurate with effort required? yes
