# Standardizing field survey data
Every time survey data comes from Nepal, it is in a non-standardized
format. This is because different students are involved in collecting the
data. This module seeks to standardize the data. This is in some sense the
dirty part of the entire process.

## Expected format

## Phases of survey
What do we mean by this, etc.
* Phase 1: All over CHAL region. Before May.
* Phase 2: Tanhau region.
