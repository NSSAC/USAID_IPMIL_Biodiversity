In recent years, deep learning has emerged as an effective tool for

discovering patterns in imagery data, with application in diverse domains,

from medical imaging to remote sensing. Epidemiological modeling is another

successful approach that is being increasingly used to study the

spatiotemporal spread of diseases, pests and plants. Here, we propose a

generic framework that combines these modern data-driven techniques to

understand the dynamics of invasive alien plant spread; a problem that has

enormous environmental and social impact.  To this end, we use historical

high-resolution satellite imagery, ecological data, and plant

presence/absence information due to extensive surveying.  There are several

challenges that need to be overcome in order to realize such a system; data

inadequacy, model complexity and heterogeneity in data formats, to name a

few. We apply this to study the spatiotemporal spread patterns of invasive

alien plant species in the Chitwan Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) region of

Nepal, a biodiversity hotspot.  The primary focus is on understanding the

roles of human activities and climate change on the rate and pattern of

spread.
